<h1>Who was C. P. Willans?</h1>

<p>It is now known (thanks to a <a href="https://youtu.be/j5s0h42GfvM">YouTube video essay</a>) that C. P. Willans gave a formula for the $n$th prime using Wilson's theorem. The video essay ends by noting that the identity of C. P. Willans seems to be unknown, even including his full name. For example, the paper on the prime-generating formula is only one publication listed on MathSciNet for "C. P. Willans", and no entry on the Mathematics Genealogy Project.</p>

<p>However, the missing identity may be explained by a typo. In the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180723004526/https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/7BD2E059FE2AB0473A82EC11BDD6B36F/S002555720005124Xa.pdf/div-class-title-mag-volume-48-issue-366-cover-and-front-matter-div.pdf">table of contents</a> of the issue of the Mathematical Gazette that the paper appears in, the author's name is listed as "C. P. Williams", a name which may be more plausible as it sounds more common. However, I am only able to find one mathematics-related publication by a "C. P. Williams", which is <i>Explorations in Quantum Computing</i> by Colin P. Williams and Scott H. Clearwater.</p>
