<h1>Ordinal collapsing functions using *just* stable ordinals</h1>

<p>There are often two paths taken when defining ordinal collapsing functions (OCFs), which is either collapsing uncountable cardinals or collapsing recursive analogues of these cardinals (e.g. $\omega_1^{CK}$ or the least recursively inaccessible ordinal). It's usually known that the second approach is possible but very difficult to work with. For example, a property such as $\psi_\pi(\alpha) < \alpha$ is easy to prove by a cardinality argument when using the first approach, but requires complicated $\Sigma_1$-definability arguments when using the second. (In "<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231207051454/http://www1.maths.leeds.ac.uk/~rathjen/realm.pdf">The Realm of Ordinal Analysis</a>", Rathjen says "it involves quite horrendous definition procedures and computations, which when taken as the first approach are at the limit of human tolerance.")</p>

<p>However, it doesn't have to be a decision between either large cardinals or their recursive analogues. Here is an ordinal collapsing function which uses the first $\omega$ stable ordinals in place of the cardinals $(\Omega_n)_{1\leq n<\omega}$, for which all ordinals used are countable and provably exist in relatively weak set theories (e.g. ZFC-Powerset and weaker), yet where basic properties about the function are not nearly as hard to prove.</p>

<p>Definition:</p>

<p>For a natural number $n$, let $\sigma_n$ be the $n$th stable ordinal (indexing from $0$), i.e. the $n$th ordinal $\sigma$ such that $L_\sigma\prec_{\Sigma_1} L$. Let $S$ be $\{\sigma_n\mid n<\omega\}$, and restrict $\pi$ to ordinals in $S$. Define the following simultaneously by transfinite recursion on $\alpha$:</p>

\begin{align*}
C_0(\alpha,\beta) & = \beta \cup \{0,\sigma_n\mid n<\omega\} \\
C_{i+1}(\alpha,\beta) & = C_i(\alpha,\beta) \cup \{\gamma+\delta \mid \gamma,\delta\in C_i(\alpha,\beta)\} \\ & \cup \{\psi_\pi(\eta) \mid \eta\in C_i(\alpha,\beta)\cap\alpha\} \\
C(\alpha,\beta) & = \bigcup_{i<\omega}C_i(\alpha,\beta) \\
\psi_\pi(\alpha) & = \min\{\beta \mid C(\alpha,\beta)\cap\pi\subseteq\beta\}
\end{align*}

<p>Lemma: For all ordinals $\alpha$ and $\pi\in S$, it holds that $\psi_\pi(\alpha) < \pi$.</p>

<p>Proof: We code $C$ in an Ord-recursive way. WIP</p>
