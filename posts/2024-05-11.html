Identity crisis in the large countable ordinals

In 1978, Magidor showed that the least strongly compact cardinal can consistently be equal to the least measurable cardinal, and it can also consistently be equal to the least supercompact cardinal, and coined the term "identity crisis" for this phenomenon. Here is an identity crisis for the large countable ordinals.

The precise statements of Magidor's results are as follows:
<ul>
<li>If ZFC+"Exists strongly compact" is consistent, then so is ZFC+"Exists strongly compact"+"The least strongly compact is the least measurable".</li>
<li>If ZFC+"Exists supercompact" is consistent, then so is ZFC+"Exists supercompact"+"The least strongly compact is the least supercompact".</li>
</ul>

We have the following (I hope):
<ul>
<li>If KP+"Exists stable" is consistent, then so is KP+"Exists stable"+"The least stable is the least $\Pi^1_1$-reflecting".</li>
<li>If KP+"Exists $\alpha$ s.t. $L_\alpha\vDash\mathrm{ZFC}$ is consistent, then so is KP+"Exists $\alpha$ s.t. $L_\alpha\vDash\mathrm{ZFC}$"+"The least stable is the least $\alpha$ s.t. $L_\alpha\vDaah\mathrm{ZFC}$".</li>
</ul>
