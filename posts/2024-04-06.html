Jeon and Walsh's preprint "<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12859">Generalized ordinal analysis and reflection principles in set theory</a>" contains some work which reminds me of Rathjen and Möllerfeld's note "<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s001530200001">A note on the $\Sigma_1$ spectrum of a theory</a>" (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220709144232/http://www1.maths.leeds.ac.uk/~rathjen/SPECK.pdf">open-access version</a>). One of the key differences is that the ordinals $\beta$ considered for $\vert T\vert_{\boldsymbol{\alpha}\text{-repr}}$ must have $T\vdash\mathsf{Exists}(\boldsymbol{\beta})^{L_\alpha}$, whereas Rathjen and Möllerfeld only require that $L\vDash\exist\xi\phi(\xi)$. To be filled in later
