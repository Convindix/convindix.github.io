Jeon and Walsh's preprint "<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12859">Generalized ordinal analysis and reflection principles in set theory</a>" contains some work which reminds me of Rathjen and Möllerfeld's note "<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s001530200001">A note on the $\Sigma_1$ spectrum of a theory</a>" (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220709144232/http://www1.maths.leeds.ac.uk/~rathjen/SPECK.pdf">open-access version</a>). Both consider $\Sigma_1$ formulas that define ordinals over some theory (in the case of Jeon and Walsh only $\mathrm{KP}_1$ is considered), but with differing caveats.

Rathjen and Möllerfeld call a $\Sigma_1$ formula $\phi$ with one free variable a "good $\Sigma_1$ definition in $T$" if $T\vdash\exists! \xi(\phi(\xi))$ and additionally $L\vDash\exists\xi(\phi(\xi))$. On the other hand, Jeon and Walsh call a $\Sigma_1$ formula $R$ with one free variable a "representation" if $\mathrm{KP}_1\vdash\exists! x(R(x))$, and call an ordinal $\alpha$ "representable" if there is some representation $R$ such that $L\vDash R(\alpha)$. From then on they mostly use boldface lowercase Greek letters to refer to representations. As Rathjen and Möllerfeld require that $T$ proves $\exists\xi(\phi(\xi))$ for $\phi$ to be consdiered a good $\Sigma_1$ definition in $T$, the notion of $T$-representability is weaker, for example $\omega_1^{CK}$ is representable ([JW], p.13) while it does not have a good $\Sigma_1$ definition on $\mathrm{KP}$ (Rathjen, "<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231207051454/http://www1.maths.leeds.ac.uk/~rathjen/realm.pdf">The Realm of Ordinal Analysis</a>", p.40, following from $\mathbf{sf}_{\Sigma_1}(\mathrm{KP})=\psi_\Omega(\varepsilon_{\Omega+1})$ and $\psi_\Omega(\varepsilon_{\Omega+1})<\omega_1^{CK}$).

One of the key differences is that the ordinals $\beta$ considered for $\vert T\vert_{\boldsymbol{\alpha}\text{-repr}}$ must have $T\vdash\mathsf{Exists}(\boldsymbol{\beta})^{L_\alpha}$, whereas Rathjen and Möllerfeld only require that $L\vDash\exist\xi\phi(\xi)$. To be filled in later, mentioning that the ordinals having good $\Sigma_1$-definitions in $T$ are an initial segment of the ordinals, under mild restrictions on $T$.
