Adjacent Ramsey Theory simplification

Here are some notes on Friedman's manuscript "<a href="https://bpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/u.osu.edu/dist/1/1952/files/2014/01/PA-incomp082910-2lgh5wm.pdf">Adjacent Ramsey Theory</a>" (2010).

<h2>Part I: A slight simplification</h2>

<p>There is a slight simplification that can be applied to the work leading up to lemma 2.8, by using a lsightly simpler ordinal notation for $\varepsilon_0$. The following content of this section presents this simplification (adapted from Friedman 2010).</p>

We use base $\omega$ Cantor normal form for ordinals $<\varepsilon_0$. For each $k\geq 0$, define the set of expressions $W(k)$ and a strict linear ordering $<_k$ on $W(k)$, as follows.

$W(0)$ consists of 0 only. $<_0$ is empty. Suppose $W(k)$, $<_k$ have been defined, where $<_k$ is a strict linear ordering on $W(k)$. Use $\leq_k$ to denote the non-strict linear ordering obtained from $<_k$. $W(k+1)$ consists of $0$ and the expressions

$$\omega^{x_1}+\ldots+\omega^{x_r}$$

where $r\geq 1$ and $x_1 \geq_k \ldots \geq_k x_r$. [The change is the lack of coefficients $c_i$.]

$<_{k+1}$ on $W(k+1)$ is defined as follows. $0$ is put at the bottom. Let $x,y\in W(k+1)$ be nonzero and distinct. Write

$$\begin{align*} x = & \omega^{x_1}+\ldots+\omega^{x_r} \\ y = & \omega^{y_1}+\ldots+\omega^{y_s}\end{align*}$$

case 1. There exists $1\leq i\leq\mathrm{min}(r,s)$ such that for all $1\leq j<i$, $\omega^{x_i}=\omega^{y_i}$ and $\omega^{x_i}\neq\omega_{y_i}$. If $x_i<_k y_i$ then $x<_{k+1}y$. If $y_i<_k x_i$ then $y<_{k+1}x$.

case 2. Otherwise. Then $x$ is a proper initial segment of $y$ or $y$ is a proper initial segment of $x$. In the former case, $x<_{k+1}y$. If the latter case, $y<_{k+1}x$.

We can easily prove by induction that $W(k)\subseteq W(k+1)$ and $<_k\subseteq<_{k+1}$ and each $<_k$ is a well-ordering that agrees with the standard ordinal interpretation of $W(k)$. This is all well known and very standard.

Fix $k\geq 0$. For $x\in W(k)$ and $i\geq 0$, we define $x[i]$ as follows. For $x=0$, take $0[i]=0$. For $x>0$, take $x[i]$ to be the $i$-th term of $x$ if $1\leq i\leq \mathrm{lth}(x)$; $0$ otherwise. Note that each nonzero $x[i]$ has an exponent.

Let $x,y\in W(k)$. Write $\mathrm{CP}(x,y)$ for the comparison position of $x,y$, which is the least $i$ such that $x[i]\neq y[i]$ if $x\neq y$; $0$ otherwise.

Write $\mathrm{CT}(x,y)$ for the comparison term of $x,y$, which is $x[\mathrm{CP}(x,y)]$.

LEMMA 2.4. The following is provablre in $\mathrm{EFA}$. $x\neq y\implies\mathrm{CP}(x,y)$ exists and is nonzero. $0<i\leq j\leq\mathrm{lth}(x)\implies x[j]\leq_k x[i]$. $x\leq_k y\iff x[\mathrm{CP}(x,y)]\leq_k y[\mathrm{CP}(x,y)}]$.

Proof: To fill in later.

<h2>Part II: Large integers</h2>

Coming soon

<h2>Part III: Extension attempts</h2>

<p>I attempted to create stronger versions of Theorem D which are equivalent to statements of the form "$\alpha$ is well-ordered" for ordinals (ordinal notations) $\alpha$ larger than $\varepsilon_0$ (in particular I attempted $\varphi_\omega(0)$ using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veblen_function">Veblen's function</a>), however I was not successful. I may return to this problem soon, using more complicated relations on $\mathbb N^r$ than Friedman's $\leq$.</p>
