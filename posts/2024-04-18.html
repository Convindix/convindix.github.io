Adjacent Ramsey Theory simplification

Here are some notes on Friedman's manuscript "<a href="https://bpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/u.osu.edu/dist/1/1952/files/2014/01/PA-incomp082910-2lgh5wm.pdf">Adjacent Ramsey Theory</a>" (2010).

<h2>Part I: A slight simplification</h2>

<p>There is a slight simplification that can be applied to the work leading up to lemma 2.8, by using a lsightly simpler ordinal notation for $\varepsilon_0$. The following blockquote presents this simplification.</p>

<pre>
We use base ω Cantor normal form for ordinals <ε_0. For each k>=0, define the set of expressions W(k) and a strict linear ordering <_k on W(k), as follows.

W(0) consists of 0 only. <_0 is empty. Suppose W(k), <_k have been defined, where <_k is a strict linear ordering on W(k). W(k+1) consists of 0 and the expressions

<h2>Part II: Large integers</h2>

Coming soon

<h2>Part III: Extension attempts</h2>

<p>I attempted to create stronger versions of Theorem D which are equivalent to statements of the form "$\alpha$ is well-ordered" for ordinals (ordinal notations) $\alpha$ larger than $\varepsilon_0$ (in particular I attempted $\varphi_\omega(0)$ using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veblen_function">Veblen's function</a>), however I was not successful. I may return to this problem soon, using more complicated relations on $\mathbb N^r$ than Friedman's $\leq$.</p>
