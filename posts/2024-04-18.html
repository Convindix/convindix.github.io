<h1>Notes on Adjacent Ramsey Theory</h1>
Here are some notes on Friedman's manuscript "<a href="https://bpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/u.osu.edu/dist/1/1952/files/2014/01/PA-incomp082910-2lgh5wm.pdf">Adjacent Ramsey Theory</a>" (2010).

<h2>Part I: A slight simplification</h2>

<p>There is a slight simplification that can be applied to the work leading up to lemma 2.8, by using a slightly simpler ordinal notation for $\varepsilon_0$. This also yields a stronger version of lemma 2.7. The following content of this section presents this simplification (adapted from Friedman 2010).</p>

<p>[$\leq$ denotes componentwise comparison between tuples from $\mathbb N$ of the same length. For a natural number $t$, $[t]$ is $\{m\in\mathbb N\mid m<t\}$. Say that "Theorem D for $r$" is the statement that for all positive integers $k$ and functions $f:\mathbb N^k \to \mathbb N^r$, there exist $x_1 < \ldots < x_{k+1}$ such that $f(x_1,\ldots,x_k)\leq f(x_2,\ldots,x_{k+1})$.]</p>

<p>We use base $\omega$ Cantor normal form for ordinals $<\varepsilon_0$. For each $k\geq 0$, define the set of expressions $W(k)$ and a strict linear ordering $<_k$ on $W(k)$, as follows.</p>

<p>$W(0)$ consists of 0 only. $<_0$ is empty. Suppose $W(k)$, $<_k$ have been defined, where $<_k$ is a strict linear ordering on $W(k)$. Use $\leq_k$ to denote the non-strict linear ordering obtained from $<_k$. $W(k+1)$ consists of $0$ and the expressions

$$\omega^{x_1}+\ldots+\omega^{x_r}$$

where $r\geq 1$ and $x_1 \geq_k \ldots \geq_k x_r$. [The change is the lack of coefficients $c_i$.]</p>

<p>$<_{k+1}$ on $W(k+1)$ is defined as follows. $0$ is put at the bottom. Let $x,y\in W(k+1)$ be nonzero and distinct. Write

$$\begin{align*} x = & \omega^{x_1}+\ldots+\omega^{x_r} \\ y = & \omega^{y_1}+\ldots+\omega^{y_s}\end{align*}$$</p>

<p>case 1. There exists $1\leq i\leq\mathrm{min}(r,s)$ such that for all $1 \leq j < i$, $\omega^{x_i}=\omega^{y_i}$ and $\omega^{x_i}\neq\omega_{y_i}$. If $x_i <_k y_i$ then $x <_{k+1} y$. If $y_i <_k x_i$ then $y <_{k+1} x$.</p>

<p>case 2. Otherwise. Then $x$ is a proper initial segment of $y$ or $y$ is a proper initial segment of $x$. In the former case, $x<_{k+1}y$. If the latter case, $y<_{k+1}x$.</p>

<p>We can easily prove by induction that $W(k)\subseteq W(k+1)$ and $<_k\subseteq<_{k+1}$ and each $<_k$ is a well-ordering that agrees with the standard ordinal interpretation of $W(k)$. This is all well known and very standard.</p>

<p>Fix $k\geq 0$. For $x\in W(k)$ and $i\geq 0$, we define $x[i]$ as follows. For $x = 0$, take $0[i] = 0$. For $x > 0$, take $x[i]$ to be the $i$-th term of $x$ if $1\leq i\leq \mathrm{lth}(x)$; $0$ otherwise. Note that each nonzero $x[i]$ has an exponent.</p>

<p>Let $x,y\in W(k)$. Write $\mathrm{CP}(x,y)$ for the comparison position of $x,y$, which is the least $i$ such that $x[i]\neq y[i]$ if $x\neq y$; $0$ otherwise.</p>

<p>Write $\mathrm{CT}(x,y)$ for the comparison term of $x,y$, which is $x[\mathrm{CP}(x,y)]$.</p>

<p>LEMMA 2.4. The following is provable in $\mathrm{EFA}$. $x\neq y\implies\mathrm{CP}(x,y)$ exists and is nonzero. $0 < i\leq j\leq\mathrm{lth}(x)\implies x[j]\leq_k x[i]$. $x \leq_k y\iff x[\mathrm{CP}(x,y)] \leq_k y[\mathrm{CP}(x,y)]$.

<p>Proof: Suppose $x\neq y$. If $x$ and $y$ are not both $0$ [originally written as $x,y\neq 0$] then obviously $\mathrm{CP}(x,y)$ exists. Since $x[0]=y[0]$, $\mathrm{CP}(x,y)>0$.</p>

<p>Suppose $0 < i \leq j \leq \mathrm{lth}(x)$. Then since $x$ is made of decreasing terms, $x[j]\leq_k x[i]$.</p>

<p>Suppose $x \leq_k y$. [Friedman may have made a typo by writing $x\leq y$.] If $x = y$ then obviously $x[\mathrm{CP}(x,y)] \leq_k y[\mathrm{CP}(x,y)]$. If $0 = x <_k y$ then $x[\mathrm{CP}(x,y)] = 0 \leq_k y[\mathrm{CP}(x,y)]$. If $0 <_k x <_k y$ then $\mathrm{CP}(x,y) > 0$, and $x[\mathrm{CP}(x,y)] <_k y[\mathrm{CP}(x,y)]$.</p>

<p>Suppose $y <_k x$. Then $\mathrm{CP}(x,y)\neq 0$. If $y=0$ then $y[\mathrm{CP}(x,y)] = 0 <_k x[\mathrm{CP}(x,y)]$. If $y\neq 0$ then $y[\mathrm{CP}(x,y)] <_k x[\mathrm{CP}(x,y)]$. QED</p>

<p>LEMMA 2.5. The following is provable in $\mathrm{EFA}$. Suppose $x,y,z\in W(k)$, $\mathrm{CP}(x,y)\leq\mathrm{CP}(y,z)$, $\mathrm{CT}(x,y) \leq_k \mathrm{CT}(y,z)$. Then $x \leq_k y$.</p>

<p>Proof: Let $x,y,z$ be as given. By [Lemma 2.4], if $\mathrm{CP}(x,y)=0$ then $x=y$. So we assume that $0<\mathrm{CP}(x,y)\leq\mathrm{CP}(y,z)$. Using Lemma 2.s1 [perhaps the second part of lemma 2.4?],

$$x[\mathrm{CP}(x,y)] = \mathrm{CT}(x,y) \leq_k \mathrm{CT}(y,z) = y[\mathrm{CP}(y,z)] \leq_k y[\mathrm{CP}(x,y)]$$.

By Lemma 2.4, $x \leq_k y$. QED</p>

<p>Write $\mathrm{CE}(x,y)$ for the comparison exponent of $x,y$, which is the exponent of $\mathrm{CT}(x,y)$ if $\mathrm{CT}(x,y) > 0$; $0$ otherwise.</p>

<p>LEMMA 2.6. The following is provable in $\mathrm{EFA}$. Suppose $x,y,z\in W(k)$, $\mathrm{CP}(x,y) \leq \mathrm{CP}(y,z)$, $\mathrm{CE}(x,y) \leq_k \mathrm{CE}(y,z)$. Then $x \leq_k y$.</p>

<p>Proof: Let $x,y,z$ be as given. By Lemma 2.5, it suffices to show that $\mathrm{CT}(x,y) \leq_k \mathrm{CT}(y,z)$.</p>

<p>Clearly, if $\mathrm{CT}(x,y)$ and $\mathrm{CT}(y,z)$ are not both $0$, then $\mathrm{CT}(x,y) \leq_k \mathrm{CT}(y,z)$.</p>

<p>Suppose $\mathrm{CT}(y,z)=0$. As $y[i]\neq 0$ for all $1\leq i\leq\mathrm{lth}(y)$, $y$ must be $0$, therefore $\mathrm{CE}(y,z) = 0$. Thus $\mathrm{CE}(x,y)=0$ as well, and both $\mathrm{CT}(x,y)$ and $\mathrm{CT}(y,z)$ are $0$. Therefore it holds that $\mathrm{CT}(x,y) \leq_k \mathrm{CT}(y,z)$. QED</p>

<p>LEMMA 2.7. The following is provable in $\mathrm{EFA}$. For all $k\geq 1$ there exists $f:W(k)^k \to \mathbb N^k$ such that the following holds. $f(x_1,\ldots,x_k)\leq f(x_2,\ldots,x_{k+1})\implies x_1 \leq_k x_2$.</p>

<p>Proof: By induction on $k\geq 1$. We first let $k=1$. Note that $W(1) = \{\underbrace{\omega^0+\ldots+\omega^0}_{n} : n\in\mathbb Z^+\}\cup\{0\}$. Set $f(x)$ to be $0$ if $x=0$, and $\mathrm{lth}(x)$ otherwise.</p>

<p>Now let $f:W(k)^k \to \mathbb N^k$ be as required. We define $g:W(k+1)^{k+1} \to \mathbb N^{k+1}$ as follows.</p>

<p>Let $x_1,\ldots,x_{k+1}\in W(k+1)$. Define $g(x_1,\ldots,x_{k+1}) =$

$$(\mathrm{CP}(x_1,x_2))\frown f(\mathrm{CE}(x_1,x_2),\mathrm{CE}(x_2,x_3),\ldots,\mathrm{CE}(x_k,x_{k+1}))$$,

[where $\frown$ denotes tuple concatenation.]</p>

<p>Now let $x_1,\ldots,x_{k+1}\in W(k+1)$, $g(x_1,\ldots,x_{k+1})\leq g(x_2,\ldots,x_{k+2})$. Clearly $g(x_2,\ldots,x_{k+2}) =$

$$(\mathrm{CP}(x_2,x_3))\frown f(\mathrm{CE}(x_2,x_3),\mathrm{CE}(x_3,x_4),\ldots,\mathrm{CE}(x_{k+1},x_{k+2})).$$</p>

<p>Hence

$$\begin{align*} \mathrm{CP}(x_1,x_2) & \leq \mathrm{CP}(x_2,x_3). \\ f(\mathrm{CE}(x_1,x_2),\mathrm{CE}(x_2,x_3),\ldots,\mathrm{CE}(x_k,x_{k+1})) & \leq f(\mathrm{CE}(x_2,x_3),\mathrm{CE}(x_3,x_4),\ldots,\mathrm{CE}(x_{k+1},x_{k+2})). \end{align*}$$</p>

<p>By the induction hypothesis, $\mathrm{CE}(x_1,x_2) \leq_k \mathrm{CE}(x_2,x_3)$.</p>

<p>Hence by Lemma 2.6, $x_1 \leq_k x_2$. QED</p>

<p>LEMMA 2.8. The following is provable in $\mathrm{RCA}_0$. Suppose Theorem D holds for $r = k$. Then $W(k)$ is well-ordered by $<_k$.</p>

<p>Proof: Let $k$ be as given. Let $g:\mathbb N\to W(k)$. Let $f:W(k)^k \to \mathbb N^k$ be given by Lemma 2.7. It suffices to find $i < j$ such that $g(i) <_k g(j)$.</p>

<p>Define $h:\mathbb N^k \to \mathbb N^k$ by

$$h(x_1,\ldots,x_k) = f(g(x_1),\ldots,g(x_k)).$$</p>

<p>By Theorem D for $h$, let $x_1,\ldots,x_{k+1}$, where

$$\begin{align*} h(x_1,\ldots,x_k) & \leq h(x_2,\ldots,x_{k+1}). \\ f(g(x_1),\ldots,g(x_k)) & \leq f(g(x_2),\ldots,g(x_{k+1})). \end{align*}$$</p>

<p>By the choice of $f$, $g(x_1) \leq g(x_2)$. Since $g$ is arbitrary, $W(k)$ is well ordered by $<_k$. QED</p>

<h2>Part II: Large integers</h2>

<p>As in Friedman, call a function $f:\subseteq\mathbb N^k\to\mathbb N^k$ limited if for all $x\in\mathrm{dom}(f)$, $\max(f(x))\leq\max(x)$. Consider the following function $R:\mathbb Z^+\to\mathbb N$: for $k\in\mathbb N$ let $R(k)$ be the least $p$ such that for all limited $f:[p]^k\to\mathbb N^k$, there are $x_1<\ldots<x_{k+1}$ such that $f(x_1,\ldots,x_k)\leq f(x_2,\ldots,x_{k+1})$.</p>

<p>The goal is to prove that $R$ grows at roughly the speed of $H_{\varepsilon_0}$. Lower bounds on some large numbers related to adjacent Ramsey theory have been obtained by Friedman and Pelupessy in "<a href="https://www.ams.org/journals/proc/2016-144-02/S0002-9939-2015-12759-1/S0002-9939-2015-12759-1.pdf">Independence of Ramsey theorem variants using $\varepsilon_0$</a>" (Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society vol. 144, 2016), however instead of bounding the $p$ where any $f:[p]^k\to\mathbb N^k$ has an adjacent Ramsey sequence as in here, they instead bound the $p$ where any $f:[p]^k\to\mathbb N^{2k+1}$ has an adjacent Ramsey sequence. The work here can be mainly summarized as first showing that the notion of limited function is permissive enough for descending sequences of ordinals to be implemented, then showing that descending sequences of ordinals can be very long.</p>

<p>Call a function $f:\operatorname{\subseteq}\mathbb N^k\to\mathbb N^k$ limited if for all $x\in\mathrm{dom}(f)$, $\max(f(x))\leq \max(x)$. Note that $f$ is limited iff for all $x\in\mathrm{dom}(f)$, $f(x)\leq (\underbrace{\max(x),\ldots,\max(x)}_k)$, this characterization will be used for convenience.</p>

<p>Define the norm function $N:\bigcup_{k\in\mathbb N}W(k) \to \mathbb N$ by $N(0) = 0$, $N(\omega^\alpha) = N(\alpha)+1$, and $N(\alpha+\beta) = N(\alpha) + N(\beta)$.</p>

<p>The next lemma is a straightforward inequality of comparison point, length, and norm.</p>

<p>Lemma 1: For any $k$ and any $\alpha,\beta\in W(k)$, $\mathrm{CP}(\alpha,\beta)\leq\mathrm{length}(\alpha) \leq N(\alpha)$, and $N(CE(\alpha,\beta)) \leq N(\alpha)$.</p>

<p>Proof: WIP $\square$</p>

<p>From here the $x$-variables should be $0$-indexed, this does not affect anything but is just convention. The following lemma may be surprising, since the bound is only $N(\alpha_0)$, which only relies on the ordinal $\alpha_0$ and not on any $\alpha_i$ for $0 < i < k$.<!--But it seems to be a correct lemma--></p>

<p>Lemma 2: Let $k \geq 1$ be a natural number, and $\alpha_0,\ldots,\alpha_{k-1}$ be a sequence of members of $W(k)$. Then $f_k(\alpha_0,\ldots,\alpha_{k-1})\leq N(\alpha_0)$.</p>

<p>Proof: Shown by induction on $k$.</p>

<p>If $k=1$, then $f_1(\alpha_0) = \mathrm{length}(\alpha_0)$, which by lemma 1 is less than or equal to $N(\alpha_0)$.</p>

<p>Suppose this has been proven for $k$ and we aim to prove it for $k+1$. Consider $f_{k+1}(\alpha_0,\ldots,\alpha_k) = (CP(\alpha_0,\alpha_1)) \frown f_k(CE(\alpha_0,\alpha_1), \ldots, CE(\alpha_{k-1},\alpha_k))$. For the first component, by lemma 1 $CP(\alpha_0,\alpha_1)\leq N(\alpha_0)$. For the remaining components, by inductive hypothesis we have $f_k(CE(\alpha_0,\alpha_1), \ldots, CE(\alpha_{k-1},\alpha_k)) \leq N(CE(\alpha_0,\alpha_1))$, which by lemma 1 is at most $N(\alpha_0)$. $\square$</p>

<p>Theorem 3: Let $k \geq 1$. If $\ell$ is a natural number<!--Appears to be no necessary lower bound on $\ell$ for this theorem to work--> such that there is a $<_k$-decreasing function $h:[\ell]\to W(k)$ such that for all $0\leq i \leq \ell-1$, $N(h(i)) \leq (k-1)+i$. There exists a limited function $g:[\ell]^k\to \mathbb N^k$ with no adjacent Ramsey sequence, i.e. no $x_0 < \ldots < x_k$ such that $g(x_0, \ldots,x_{k-1})\leq g(x_1, \ldots, x_k)$.</p>

Check this: Is a lower bound like $\ell\geq 1$ necessary?

<p>Proof: Let $\ell$, $h$ be as given, and let $f_k:W(k)^k\to\mathbb N^k$ and $f_{k-1}:W(k-1)^{k-1}\to\mathbb N^{k-1}$ be as in lemma 2.7. Consider the function $g(x_0,\ldots,x_{k-1}) = f_k(h(x_0),\ldots,h(x_{k-1}))$, whose domain is also $[\ell]^k$. First, we show that $g$ has no adjacent Ramsey sequence. For any $x_0 < \ldots < x_k \in [\ell]$, $g(x_0, \ldots, x_{k-1})\leq g(x_1, \ldots, x_k)$ is equivalent to $f_k(h(x_0), \ldots, h(x_{k-1})) \leq f(h(x_1), \ldots, h(x_k))$. By lemma 2.7 this is equivalent to $h(x_0) \leq_k h(x_1)$, and since $x_0 < x_1$, by $<_k$-decreasingness of $h$, this is false. Therefore for no $x_0 < \ldots < x_k \in [\ell]$ can we have $g(x_0, \ldots, x_{k-1}) \leq g(x_1, \ldots, x_k)$.</p>

<p>Now, we show that $g$ is limited. Let $(x_0,\ldots,x_{k-1})\in\mathrm{dom}(g)$. For $0\leq i\leq k-1$, let $\alpha_i$ denote $h(x_i)$. Then $g(x_0, \ldots, x_{k‐1}) = f_k(\alpha_0, \ldots, \alpha_{k-1})$. By lemma 2, we have $f_k(\alpha_0, \ldots, \alpha_{k-1}) \leq N(\alpha_0)$. By the bound on the norm of $\alpha_0$, this is at most $(k-1)+x_0$. As $x_0 < \ldots < x_{k-1}$, we have $x_{k-1} \geq (k-1)+x_0$ and $x_{k-1} = \max\{x_0,\ldots,x_{k-1}\}$, so $f_k(\alpha_0, \ldots, \alpha_{k-1}) \leq \max\{x_0,\ldots,x_{k-1}\}$. $\square$</p>

<p>Define fundamental sequences for limit ordinals $\leq\varepsilon_0$ by the following cases:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If $\alpha,\beta<\varepsilon_0$, then for $n\in\mathbb N$, define $(\alpha+\omega^{\beta+1})[n] = \alpha+\omega^\beta n$, and define $(\alpha+\omega^\beta)[n] = \alpha+\omega^{\beta[n]}$ if $\beta$ is a limit ordinal.</li>
  <li>For $n\in\mathbb N$, define $\varepsilon_0[n]$ by $\varepsilon_0[0] = 0$ and $\varepsilon_0[n+1] = \omega^{\varepsilon_0[n]}$.</li>
</ul>

Recall the definition of the Hardy hierarchy of functions $H:\varepsilon_0\to(\mathbb N\to\mathbb N)$:

<ul>
  <li>$H_0(n) = n$,</li>
  <li>$H_{\alpha+1}(n) = H_\alpha(n+1)$,</li>
  <li>For limit $\alpha$, $H_\alpha(n) = H_{\alpha[n]}(n)$.</li>
</ul>

<p>For $\alpha\in W$ and $n\in\mathbb N$, define $G_n(\alpha)$ to be the $>$-greatest member $\beta$ of $W$ such that $\beta<\alpha$ and $N(\beta)\leq n$.

<p>Define the hierarchy $NH:\varepsilon_0\to(\mathbb N\to\mathbb N)$:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$NH_0(n) = n$,</li>
  <li>For $\alpha>0$, $NH_\alpha(n) = NH_{G_{n+1}(\alpha)}(n+1)$.</li>
</ul>

<p>Lemma 4: If $0<\alpha<\varepsilon_0$ is an ordinal, and $\beta<\alpha$ is such that $N(\beta)\leq m$, and $m\leq n$, then $\beta\leq G_n(\alpha)$.</p>

<p>Proof: $G_n(\alpha)$ is the maximum of the set $\{\gamma<\alpha\mid N(\gamma)\leq n\}$, which $\beta$ is a member of. $\square$</p>

<p>Lemma 5: For $\alpha\leq\beta<\varepsilon_0$, for $m\leq n\in\mathbb N$, $NH_\alpha(m)\leq NH_\beta(n)$.</p>

<p>Proof: By transfinite induction on $\beta$. If $\beta=0$, then $\alpha=0$, and $NH_0(m)=m\leq n=NH_0(n)$. If $\beta>0$, then $NH_\alpha(m)=NH_\gamma(m+1)$ where $\gamma=G_{m+1}(\alpha)$, and $NH_\beta(n)=NH_\delta(n+1)$ where $\delta=G_{n+1}(\alpha)$. By lemma 4, $\gamma\leq\delta$. As $m+1\leq n+1$, by inductive hypothesis we have $NH_\gamma(m+1)\leq NH_\delta(n+1)$. $\square$</p>

<p>Lemma 6: Let $\alpha\in W$, and let $n=N(\alpha)$. For all natural numbers $k$ such that $k\geq N(\alpha)$, it holds that $N(\alpha[k]) \leq n^2+(k-n)n$.</p>

<p>Proof: By transfinite induction on $\alpha\in W$.</p>

<p>Update everything below for the new lemma statement!</p>

<p>If $\alpha=\omega$, then $n\geq 2$ and $\alpha[k]=k$, so $N(\alpha[k]) = k \leq k^2+(k-n)n$.</p>

<p>For the rest of this proof, assume that $\alpha > \omega$, that this has been shown for all limit ordinals $\beta < \alpha$, and that our goal is to show it for $\alpha$.</p>

<p>Assume $\alpha$ is of the form $\omega^{\beta+1}$. Then $N(\alpha[k]) = N(\omega^\beta \cdot k) = N(\omega^\beta) \cdot k = (n-1) \cdot k \leq (k-n)n \leq k^2+(k-n)n$.</p>

<p>Assume $\alpha > \omega$ is of the form $\omega^\beta$ for $\beta$ a limit ordinal. Since $\alpha>\omega$, we must have $N(\alpha)\geq 2$ and thus $n\geq 2$. Then $N(\alpha[k]) = N(\omega^{\beta[k]}) = 1+N(\beta[k])$ Fix from here on!. By applying this theorem on $\beta[n+k]$ with $n-1$ for $n$ and $1$ for $k+1$, we have that this number is less than or equal to $1+(n-1)^2+(k+1)n \leq n^2+(k-1)n+2$. As $n\geq 2$, this is less than or equal to $n^2+kn$.</p>

<p>Assume $\alpha > \omega$ is of the form $\gamma+\omega^\beta$. By definition of $W$, we have $\gamma\geq\omega^\beta$. Then $N(\alpha[n+k]) = N(\gamma+(\omega^\beta)[n+k]) = N(\gamma) + N(\omega^\beta[n+k])$, which by induction hypothesis is less than or equal to $N(\gamma) + n^2+kn$. Since $N(\gamma) < N(\alpha)$, this number is less than $n + n^2+kn$. Try using $k$ here? WIP $\square$</p>

<p>Lemma 7: For any ordinal $\alpha<\varepsilon_0$ and natural number $n\geq N(\alpha)$, $NH_\alpha(n^2)\geq H_\alpha(n)$.</p>

<p>Proof: By transfinite induction on $\alpha<\varepsilon_0$.</p>

<p>Assume $\alpha=0$. Then $NH_0(n^2) = n^2 \geq H_0(n) = n$.</p>

<p>Assume that $\alpha$ is a successor ordinal, that we have shown this for $\beta$, and we intend to show it for $\alpha$. WIP</p>

<p>Assume that $\alpha>0$ is a limit ordinal, and that this has been shown for every $\beta<\alpha$, and we intend to show it for $\alpha$. $NH_\alpha(n^2)$ equals $NH_\gamma(n^2+1)$ where $\gamma=G_{n^2+1}(\alpha)$. We have $\alpha[n] < \alpha$, and by lemma 6 we have $N(\alpha[n]) \leq n^2+1$, so $\gamma \geq \alpha[n]$. Then by lemma 5, $NH_\gamma(n^2+1)\geq NH_{\alpha[n]}(n^2+1)$. By lemma 6 we have $n^2+1\geq N(\alpha[n])$, so we can apply the inductive hypothesis to obtain that $NH_{\alpha[n]}(n^2+1) \geq H_{\alpha[n]}(n)$. So $NH_\alpha(n^2) \geq H_\alpha(n)$. $\square$</p>

<p>Lemma 8: Let $k>0$, let $n$ be a natural number, and let $\alpha\in W(k)$ be such that $N(\alpha)\leq n$. Let $\ell$ be $NH_\alpha(n)-(n-1)$. There is a $<_k$-decreasing function $h:[\ell]\to W(k)$ such that for all $0\leq i\leq\ell$, $N(h(i)) \leq n+i$.</p>

<p>Proof: Let $k,n,\alpha$ be as given. Define the trace of $NH_0(n)$ to be the sequence of ordinals $(0)$, and for $\alpha>0$ define the trace of $NH_\alpha(n)$ to be $(\alpha)$ concatenated with the trace of $NH_{G_{n+1}(\alpha)}(n+1)$. The trace of $NH_\alpha(n)$ is the sequence of ordinal indices of $NH$ appearing in the evaluation of $NH_\alpha(n)$, in $<$-descending order. For $k,n,\alpha$ such that $N(\alpha) \leq n$, it may be proved by induction on $\alpha$ that the length of the trace of $NH_\alpha(n)$ is $NH_\alpha(n)-(n-1)$. Thus for any such $k,n,\alpha$, the trace of $NH_\alpha(n)$ is a desired sequence of length $\ell$. $\square$</p>

<p>Corollary 9: For $k > 0$, $R(k) > NH_{\varepsilon_0[k]}(k)-(k-1)$.</p>

<p>Proof: First, prove by induction on $i$ that for arbitrary natural $i$, $N(\varepsilon_0[i]) = i$. Then, let $k > 0$ be arbitrary, and let $\ell = NH_{\varepsilon_0[k]}(k)-(k-1)$. Apply lemma 8 with $n=k$ and $\alpha=\varepsilon_0[k]$, then theorem 3 to obtain a limited function $g:[\ell]^k\to\mathbb N^k$ with no adjacent Ramsey sequence. $\square$</p>

<p>Corollary 10: For $k > 3$, $R(k) > H_{\varepsilon_0[k]}(\lfloor\sqrt{k}\rfloor) - (k-1)$.</p>

<h2>Part III: Extension attempts</h2>

<p>I attempted to create stronger versions of Theorem D which imply statements of the form "$\alpha$ is well-ordered" for ordinals (ordinal notations) $\alpha$ larger than $\varepsilon_0$ (in particular I attempted $\varphi_\omega(0)$ using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veblen_function">Veblen's function</a>), however I was not successful. I may return to this problem soon, using more complicated relations on $\mathbb N^r$ than Friedman's $\leq$.</p>

<p>These versions of Theorem D are only conjecturally true, as the infinite Ramsey theorem fails to prove them.</p>

<h2>Part IV: Adjacent Ramsey theory on other wqos</h2>

<p>This is what happens when considering functions $f:B^k\to B^k$ for other wqos $(B,\prec)$.</p>

<p>Define CP, CT, CE for members of $\boldsymbol\omega^{B,k}$ with $k > 0$.</p>

<p>Version of lemma 2.7: Assume $(B,\prec)$ is a wqo, and let $k>0$ be a natural number. There is a function $f_k:\boldsymbol\omega^{B^k,k}\to B^k$ such that $f_k(x_0,\ldots,x_{k-1})\leq f_k(x_1,\ldots,x_k)$ implies $x_0\leq x_1$.

<p>Proof: By cases on cardinality of $B$. Assume $B$ is finite. Try showing it's trivial for finite $B$.

Assume $B$ is infinite. There is a $\prec$-increasing injection $m:\mathbb N\to B$ which we will use as a coding function. Define f_1 somehow, and define $f_{k+1}(x_0,\ldots,x_k) = (m(CP(x_0,x_1))) \frown f_k(CE(x_0,x_1),\ldots,CE(x_{k-1},x_k))$. WIP

<p>Coming soon</p>

<p>Keep in mind theorem 1.7 of "The Veblen function for computability theorists"</p>
