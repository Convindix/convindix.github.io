<h1>Possible example of arithmetical splitting?</h1>

<p>Kriesel's 1971 paper "Observations on popular discussions of foundations" contains the following quote:</p>

<p>"Specifically, more than 25 years ago I found a perfectly natural formula of this form [$\Delta^0_2$] (and published it later in [K1]) which we know to be formally undecidable in set theory. But nobody has any idea whether it is true or false."</p>

<p>The reference to the formula itself is "<a href="https://bibliotekanauki.pl/articles/1383474">Note on arithmetic models for consistent formulae of the predicate calculus</a>", also by Kriesel, from Fundamenta Mathemtaticae vol. 37, iss. 1 (1950). I will have to find the formula itself (it appears to be "$e[i^*(u^*)u^*]=0$"), the set theory it is independent from. I don't know if the arithmetical splitting project only looks for statements that are natural in the sense that the Paris-Harrington principle is natural, or if a success could also mean a statement coming from logic (such as this one?) which has no agreed-upon canonical truth value.</p>
