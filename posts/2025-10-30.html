Skolem hulls are not necessarily minimal elementary substructures

Take the Skolem hull of any nonempty set in $(\mathbb Q,<)$. Remove a point from the hull. The resulting model is still a dense linear ordering without endpoints, so it has the same theory as $(\mathbb Q,<)$ (even with parameters?), yet it is a proper substructure of the Skolem hull.

Edit 7 November: I now think that this example doesn't work. If $X$ is a subset of $\mathbb Q$, then the Skolem hull of $X$ in $(\mathbb Q,<)$ will be exactly equal to $X$, since no other points will be definable due to the automorphisms $(\mathbb Q,<)$ has. Then removing a point from the hull, i.e. from $X$, doesn't give a proper elementary substructure *which includes $X$*. So it may still be possible that Skolem hulls are minimal substructures.
