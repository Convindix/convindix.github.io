Skolem hulls are not necessarily minimal elementary substructures

Take the Skolem hull of any nonempty set in $(\mathbb Q,<)$. Remove a point from the hull. The resulting model is still a dense linear ordering without endpoints, so it has the same theory as $(\mathbb Q,<)$ (even with parameters?), yet it is a proper substructure of the Skolem hull.
