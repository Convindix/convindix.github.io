<h1>A similarity between Friedman's mythical trees and Mills's arboreal principle</h1>

<p>In the paper "A tree analysis of unprovable combinatorial statements", Mills defines the notion of a $c$-arboreal set for a natural number $c$, and states that the interval $[2,41\cdot 2^{39}-2]$ is not $3$-arboreal, while the interval $[2,41\cdot 2^{39}-1]$ is $3$-arboreal. (G. Mills, "A tree analysis of unprovable combinatorial statements". In ''Model Theory of Algebra and Arithmetic'', Lecture Notes in Mathematics vol. 834 (1980). ISBN 3-540-10269-8.)<sup>p. 255</sup> The appearance of $41\cdot 2^{39}-1$ both here and in Friedman's mythical tree problem may not be a coincidence.</p>

<p>Consider the mythical tree problem for four branch segments. We number steps in an unorthodox way, where step $0$ is the placement of the root, steps $1$ and $2$ are the placement of the root's two children, steps $3$, $4$, and $5$ are the placement of three new treetops on one of those children (nondeterministic), etc. Note that now, new vertices may not necessarily be added to leaf vertices.</p>

<p><b>Theorem:</b> Let $k$ be a natural number. The mythical tree construction can be carried out up to step $k$ iff the interval $[2,k+2]$ is not $3$-arboreal.</p>

<p><b>Proof:</b> ($\rightarrow$) Assume that the mythical tree construction can be carried out up to step $k$. Take a mythical tree constructed by step $k$ and label each of its vertices with the natural number $2+i$ where $i$ is the step at which that vertex was added. Since the vertex added at step $i$ of the mythical tree construction has at most $i+2$ children and it receives label $i+2$, the resulting $[2,k+2]$-tree is small-branching. However, since the tree is a mythical tree, it has no paths of length $\geq 5$. So the tree is $3$-arboreal. ($\leftarrow$) Assume that the interval $[2,k+2]$ is not $3$-arboreal. Let $\prec$ be a small-branching $[2,k+2]$-tree which does not have any path of length $\geq 5$. We obtain a $k$-step construction of a mythical tree as follows: for a natural number $i\leq k$, let the tree at step $i$ be the subtree of $\prec$ induced by the set $[2,i+2]$. Denote this tree by $T_i$. The tree $T_i$ is a $[2,i+2]$-tree, since the property $a\prec b\implies a < b$ is inherited from $\prec$. Also, $T_i$ is small-branching, since any node in $T_i$ has at most as many nodes as it did in $\prec$. WIP. So this is a valid $k$-step long mythical tree construction. (TODO: Is it? The nodes may be added out of order.) $\square$</p>

<p>However there seems to be a discrepancy between mythical trees and $3$-arboreal sets which may refute the above theorem. Friedman says that the number of branches grown by the mythical tree only in the final step of its construction is $41\cdot 2^{39}-2$, not the total number of vertices in the tree. However, when looking at $3$-arboreal sets, $[2,41\cdot 2^{39}-2]$ not being $3$-arboreal means there is a tree with $41\cdot 2^{39}-3$ <i>nodes</i> and height $4$ witnessing a certain property. It seems like the mythical tree would be much larger than the $3$-arboreal set, if $41\cdot 2^{39}-2$ is just the number of segments added in the final step of its construction.</p>
