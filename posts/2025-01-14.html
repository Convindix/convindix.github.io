A somewhat disappointing, but clear in retrospect, result on a new large cardinal axiom (Ramsey reflection)

A cardinal $\kappa$ is stationary reflecting (sometimes known as $2$-reflecting) if for all sets $S\subseteq\kappa$ which are stationary in $\alpha$, there is an ordinal $\alpha < \kappa$ such that $S\cap\alpha$ is stationary in $\alpha$. Assuming $V=L$, all regular stationary reflecting cardinals are weakly compact, so this boosts the strength up from Mahloness.

This property can be rephrased in the language of large cardinal ideals: For an ordinal $\alpha$, let $\mathrm{NS}_\alpha$ be the nonstationary ideal on $\alpha$. Then a cardinal $\kappa$ is stationary reflecting iff for all $S$ in $\mathrm{NS}^+_\kappa$, there is an ordinal $\alpha < \kappa$ such that $S\cap\alpha$ is in $\mathrm{NS}^+_\alpha$.

This raises the question of what kinds of large cardinal properties come from replacing the nonstationary ideal with another ideal, for example the Ramsey ideal.

The Ramsey ideal is defined in Feng's paper "<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016800729090028Z">A hierarchy of Ramsey cardinals</a>" (Annals of Pure and Applied logic vol. 49, iss. 3, 1990). Given an ideal $I\supseteq [\kappa]^{<\kappa}$ on a cardinal $\kappa$, define $\mathcal R^+(I)$ to be the set of $X\subseteq\kappa$ such that for every regressive function $f:[X]^{<\omega}\to\kappa$, for every club $C\subseteq\kappa$, there is a $Y\in I^+$ which is homogeneous for $f$ such that $Y\subseteq X\cap C$.

Let $\mathcal R_\kappa$ denote the Ramsey ideal on $\kappa$. Now, define a cardinal $\kappa$ to be Ramsey reflecting if for all 

(Spoiler alert: the consistency strength is upper-bounded by "there is a totally indescribable Ramsey cardinal".)
