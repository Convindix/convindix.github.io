A somewhat disappointing, but clear in retrospect, result on a new large cardinal axiom (Ramsey reflection)

A cardinal $\kappa$ is stationary reflecting (sometimes known as $2$-reflecting) if for all sets $S\subseteq\kappa$ which are stationary in $\alpha$, there is an ordinal $\alpha < \kappa$ such that $S\cap\alpha$ is stationary in $\alpha$. Assuming $V=L$, all regular stationary reflecting cardinals are weakly compact, so this boosts the strength up from Mahloness.

This property can be rephrased in the language of large cardinal ideals: For an ordinal $\alpha$, let $\mathrm{NS}_\alpha$ be the nonstationary ideal on $\alpha$. Then a cardinal $\kappa$ is stationary reflecting iff for all $S$ in $\mathrm{NS}^+_\kappa$, there is an ordinal $\alpha < \kappa$ such that $S\cap\alpha$ is in $\mathrm{NS}^+_\alpha$.

This raises the question of what kinds of large cardinal properties come from replacing the nonstationary ideal with another ideal, for example the Ramsey ideal.

Define the Ramsey ideal on a cardinal $\kappa$: (as defined in Cody's "<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.13540">A refinement of the Ramsey hierarchy via indescribability</a>", p. 2) a set $S\subseteq\kappa$ is Ramsey (with respect to $\kappa$) if for every regressive function $f:[S]^{<\omega}\to\kappa$ there is a homogeneous set $H\subseteq S$ of size $\kappa$. Define the Ramsey ideal on $\kappa$ to be the set of all subsets of $\kappa$ which are not Ramsey.

Let $\mathcal R_\kappa$ denote the Ramsey ideal on $\kappa$. Now, define a cardinal $\kappa$ to be Ramsey reflecting if for all $S$ in $\mathcal R^+_\kappa$, there is an ordinal $\alpha < \kappa$ such that $S\cap\alpha$ is in $\mathcal R^+_\alpha$.

(Spoiler alert: the consistency strength is upper-bounded by "there is a totally indescribable Ramsey cardinal".)
