<h1>A somewhat disappointing, but clear in retrospect, result on a new large cardinal axiom (Ramsey reflection)</h1>

<p>A cardinal $\kappa$ is stationary reflecting (sometimes known as $2$-reflecting) if for all sets $S\subseteq\kappa$ which are stationary in $\alpha$, there is an ordinal $\alpha < \kappa$ such that $S\cap\alpha$ is stationary in $\alpha$. Assuming $V=L$, all regular stationary reflecting cardinals are weakly compact, so this boosts the strength up from Mahloness.</p>

<p>This property can be rephrased in the language of large cardinal ideals: For an ordinal $\alpha$, let $\mathrm{NS}_\alpha$ be the nonstationary ideal on $\alpha$. Then a cardinal $\kappa$ is stationary reflecting iff for all $S$ in $\mathrm{NS}^+_\kappa$, there is an ordinal $\alpha < \kappa$ such that $S\cap\alpha$ is in $\mathrm{NS}^+_\alpha$.</p>

<p>This raises the question of what kinds of large cardinal properties come from replacing the nonstationary ideal with another ideal, for example the Ramsey ideal.</p>

<p>Define the Ramsey ideal on a cardinal $\kappa$: (as defined in Cody's "<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.13540">A refinement of the Ramsey hierarchy via indescribability</a>", p. 2) a set $S\subseteq\kappa$ is Ramsey (with respect to $\kappa$) if for every regressive function $f:[S]^{<\omega}\to\kappa$ there is a homogeneous set $H\subseteq S$ of size $\kappa$. Define the Ramsey ideal on $\kappa$ to be the set of all subsets of $\kappa$ which are not Ramsey.</p>

<p>Let $\mathcal R_\kappa$ denote the Ramsey ideal on $\kappa$. Now, define a cardinal $\kappa$ to be Ramsey reflecting if for all $S$ in $\mathcal R^+_\kappa$, there is an ordinal $\alpha < \kappa$ such that $S\cap\alpha$ is in $\mathcal R^+_\alpha$.</p>

<p>(Spoiler alert: the consistency strength is upper-bounded by "there is a totally indescribable Ramsey cardinal".)</p>

<p>Theorem: Assume $\kappa$ is a totally indescribable Ramsey cardinal. Then $\kappa$ is Ramsey reflecting.</p>

<p>Proof: Let $S$ be an arbitrary member of $\mathcal R^+_\kappa$. Let $\phi(S, WIP </p>
