The consistency strength of Ord-indescribability

For an ordinal $\alpha$, say that a cardinal $\kappa$ is $\alpha$-indescribable if for all first-order formulas $\phi$ with parameters from $V_\kappa$ and all $A\subseteq V_\kappa$, if $V_{\kappa+\alpha}\vDash\phi(A)$ then there is a $\beta<\kappa$ such that $V_{\beta+\alpha}\vDash\phi(A\cap V_\beta)$. It is known (e.g. it is an exercise at the end of chapter 9 of Drake's *Set Theory: An Introduction to Large Cardinals*, 1974) that there is no $\kappa$ that is $\kappa$-indescribable. The trick used in the inconsistency proof is to let $A=\kappa$, then write a formula $\phi(A)$ that roughly says "$A$ is an ordinal and $\mathrm{Ord}$ is $A\cdot 2$", the contradiction being that for any $\beta<\alpha$, $A\cap V_\beta=\beta$, yet $V_\kappa$ does not satisfy "$\mathrm{Ord}$ is $\beta\cdot 2$" since $V_{\beta+\kappa}=V_\kappa$.

However, this argument does not rule out $\alpha$-indescribability of $\kappa$ when $\alpha$ is far larger than $\kappa$, in particular when $\alpha$ is so much larger than $\kappa$ that there is no reasonable way to state "$\mathrm{Ord}$ is the range of some definable function with domain $A$". In fact, it turns out that (relative to existence of an $\omega$-Erdős cardinal, it is consistent that there is a $\kappa$ that is "$\mathrm{Ord}$-indescribable": for any formula $\phi$ and $A\subseteq V_\kappa$, if $V\vDash\phi(A)$, then there is a $\beta<\alpha$ such that $V\vDash\phi(A\cap V_\beta)$! As this definition requires a truth predicate for $V$, it is necessary to carry it out in e.g. a second-order set theory that has such a truth predicate for $V$, such as $\mathrm{GBC}^-+\mathrm{ETR}_{\omega^\omega}$. (See Williams, <i><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.09526v1">The Structure of Models of Second-order Set Theories</a></i>, 2018). To prove its consistency, assume $\pi$ is $\omega$-Erdős, take Drake's theorem 4.3 of chapter 9, then (if I am correct) $(V_\pi,V_{\pi+1})$ is a model of $\mathrm{GBC}^-+\mathrm{ETR}_{\omega^\omega}+``\text{there is an Ord-indescribable cardinal}"$.

Theorem: If $\kappa$ is $\mathrm{Ord}$-indescribable, then $\kappa$ is subtle.

Proof: Let $\kappa$ be $\mathrm{Ord}$-indescribable. WIP $\square$

Stronger than shrewdness, which holds for each $\lambda>\kappa$ but is not single uniform truth in $V$? Also shrewdness is weaker than subtlety?
