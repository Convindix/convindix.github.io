Useful lemma from overspill

Let M be nonstandard. If $M\vDash\phi(e)$ for every nonstandard $e\in M$, then there is some standard $n\in M$ such that for all $n < n' < \mathbb N$, $M\vDash\phi(n')$. The tagline is "if it holds for every nonstandard natural, it holds for a cofinal segment of the standard naturals".

Proof: For all nonstandard e in M we have not only M vDash phi(e), but also M vDash forall(e' > e)phi(e'). Then apply overspill to the latter formula to get that there is a standard natural n in M such that M vDash forall(n' > n)phi(n'). QED
