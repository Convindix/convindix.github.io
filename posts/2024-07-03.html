A problem about nonprojectible ordinals

What is the least PoR-nonprojectible ordinal? I.e. what is the least $\alpha$ such that for all $\beta<\alpha$, there is no $\Sigma_1$ (in the language of PoR)-definable injection from $\alpha$ into $\beta$?

Let $\alpha$ be the supremum of an infinite $<_1$-chain $(\alpha_i)_{i<\omega}$. Then $\alpha$ is PoR-nonprojectible?
