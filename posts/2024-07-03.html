A problem about PoR-nonprojectible ordinals

What is the least PoR-nonprojectible ordinal? I.e. what is the least $\alpha$ such that for all $\beta<\alpha$, there is no $\Sigma_1$ (in the language of PoR)-definable surjection from $\beta$ onto $\alpha$?

Let $\alpha$ be the supremum of an infinite $<_1$-chain $(\alpha_i)_{i<\omega}$. Then $\alpha$ is PoR-nonprojectible? Taking any $f:\beta\to\alpha$ which is $\Sigma_1$ on $(\alpha,\leq,\leq_1)$, for any $\xi<\beta$, if it holds that $\alpha\vDash\exists\gamma(f(\xi)=\gamma)$, then this holds in some $\alpha_i$ containing $\xi$. But for all I know there may be an $f$ that for any $\alpha_i$ has a $\xi$ where $f(\xi)<\alpha_i$ fails.
