Two problems about nonprojectible ordinals

What is the least PoR-nonprojectible ordinal? I.e. what is the least $\alpha$ such that for all $\beta<\alpha$, there is no $\Sigma_1$ (in the language of PoR)-definable injection from $\alpha$ into $\beta$

Let $\alpha$ be the least nonprojectible ordinal. What is the order type of $\{M\mid M\prec_{\Sigma_1}L_\alpha\}$ under $<_L$? (Not necessarily $\omega$)
