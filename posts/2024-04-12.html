<h1>$\Sigma_2$- and $\Sigma_1(St)$-definability</h1>
<p><b>Edit April 2024:</b> One of the main goals of this post (showing that $S^1_\alpha\cap L_{\rho^1_\alpha}$ is a valid $\Sigma_1$ master code for $L_\alpha$, at least as far as $\Sigma_2$ formulas are concerned) turned out to be a false theorem. This post will continue with some related results obtained along the way.</p>

<p>It has been considered by multiple authors (such as in Kranakis's "<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0003484382900225">Reflection and partition properties of admissible ordinals</a>" and Arai's "<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1102.0596v1">A sneak preview of proof theory of ordinals</a>") to extend the language of set theory by a predicate for stability of an ordinal. This is particularly considered when studying either proof theory (as in Arai) or large nonrecursive countable ordinals (as in Kranakis). Here, as in Kranakis, we list some small resuts on the predicates which are $\Sigma_1(St)$-definable and $\Sigma_2$-definable over a given level of $L$. Much of this work is likely generalizable to the $\Sigma_n$ case where $n>2$, while nothing much new may occur there we will just deal with $n=1$ here.</p>

<h1>Part I: $\Sigma_2(L_\beta,\in)$ and $\Sigma_1(L_\beta,\in,S^1_\beta)$</h1>

<p>Following Kranakis82, for an ordinal $\beta$ we let $S^1_\beta$ denote the set of ordinals that are $\alpha$-stable. As in Devlin74, we say that $R\subseteq M$ is $\Sigma_n^M(P)$ if it is definable by a $\Sigma_n$ formula over $M$ with parameters from $P$, and wey say $R$ is $\Sigma_n(M)$ if it is $\Sigma_n^M(M)$. As we will write $\Sigma_n(M)$ for some structures $M$ which are denoted with parentheses, e.g. $\Sigma_1((L_\beta,\in,S^1_\beta))$, we will drop the parentheses and write $\Sigma_1(L_\beta,\in,S^1_\beta)$.</p>

<p>I recall seeing a general version of the next lemma in Devlin74, but when I looked for it I could not find it again.</p>

<p>Lemma 1: Let $\alpha,\beta$ be ordinals such that $\alpha<\beta$. Then $L_\alpha\prec_{\Sigma_2}L_\beta$ iff $\Sigma_2^{(L_\beta,\in)}(L_\alpha)=\Sigma_2^{(L_\beta,\in)}(L_\beta)$.</p>

<p>Proof: ($\rightarrow$) Assume $L_\alpha\prec_{\Sigma_2}L_\beta$ and let $A$ be a member of $\Sigma_2^{(L_\beta,\in)}(\alpha)$. WIP. ($\leftarrow$) WIP.</p>

<p>Theorem 1: When $\beta$ is nonprojectible, $\Sigma_1(L_\beta,\in,S^1_\beta) = \Sigma_2(L_\beta,\in)$.</p>

<p>Proof: ($\subseteq$) Given that $S^1_\beta$ is $\Pi_1$ on $L_\beta$ (Kranakis82), this direction is trivial. ($\supseteq$) Let $A$ be a member of $\Sigma_2(L_\beta,\in)$, with a $\Sigma_2$ formula $\phi$ and a sequence of parameters $\vec p$ from $L_\beta$ such that $A=\{z\in L_\beta\mid (L_\beta,\in)\vDash\phi(z,\vec p)\}$. Put $\phi$ in the form $\exists x\psi(x,z,\vec p)$, where $\psi$ is $\Pi_1$. We will now show that $\exists\sigma\exists(x\in L_\sigma)(St(\sigma)\land(L_\sigma,\in)\vDash\psi(x,z,\vec p))$ is a formula defining $A$ on the structure $(L_\beta,\in,S^1_\beta)$. Given a $z\in A$, choose an $x$ such that $L_\beta\vDash\exists x\psi(z,x,\vec p)$. As $\beta$ is nonprojectible, there exists a $\sigma$ such that $\sigma$ is $\beta$-stable, and $z$, $x$, and every entry of $\vec p$ are in $L_\sigma$, as $\vec p$ is finitely long. Since $(L_\beta,\in)\vDash\phi(z,x,\vec p)$, by $\Sigma_1$-elementarity, $(L_\sigma,\in)\vDash\phi(z,x,\vec p)$. As any $\sigma\in L_\beta$ such that $(L_\beta,\in,S^1_\beta)\vDash St(\sigma)$ must be $\beta$-stable, this formula defines $A$ over $(L_\beta,\in,S^1_\beta)$, and therefore $A$ is $\Sigma_1(L_\beta,\in,S^1_\beta)$. $\square$</p>

<p>Theorem 2: Assume that $S^1_\beta$ is nonempty, and $\alpha$ is an ordinal which is $\beta$-stable. Then $\Sigma_1^{(L_\beta,\in,S^1_\beta)}(L_\alpha)\cap\mathcal P(L_\alpha) = \Sigma_2^{(L_\beta,\in)}(L_\alpha)\cap\mathcal P(L_\alpha)$?</p>

<p>Proof: ($\subseteq$) Given that $S^1_\beta$ is $\Pi_1$ on $L_\beta$ (Kranakis82), this direction is trivial. ($\supseteq$) Let $A$ be $\Sigma_2^{(L_\beta,\in)}(L_\alpha)$, and $\phi$ be a $\Sigma_2$ formula with a sequence of parameters $\vec p$ from $L_\alpha$ such that $A=\{z\in L_\alpha\mid (L_\beta,\in)\vDash\phi(z,\vec p)\}$. Put $\phi$ in the form $\exists x\psi(x,z,\vec p)$ where $\psi$ is $\Pi_1$. WIP Now we show that for $z\in L_\alpha$, $(L_\beta,\in)\vDash \exists x\psi(x,z,\vec p)$ iff $(L_\beta,\in,S^1_\beta)\vDash \exists\sigma\exists x(St(\sigma)\land (L_\sigma,\in)\vDash\psi(x,z,\vec p))$.
