X Berkeley cardinals

This is a silly thing which I have considered in the past. XX but Berkeley cardinals are inconsistent with choice, there isn't much use for this. Since these are also "overly strong" large cardinals, maybe an inconsistency proof of X Berkeleys can be weakened to produce a proof of inconsistency with ZF, which maybe could be further weakened to produce an inconsistency proof of Berkeleys with ZF?
