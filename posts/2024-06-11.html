A philosophical distinction between the busy beaver and Rayo functions

There is no $\Sigma^0_1$ formula $\phi(n)$ such that $\phi(\overline n)$ is independent of ZFC for every natural number $n$, so there cannot be a Turing machine $\{e\}$ with a "CH-in-Rayo-like" scenario, where for every $n\in\mathbb N$ there is a model of ZFC in which $\{e\}$ outputs $n$. Only nonstanadrd natural shenanigans allowed
