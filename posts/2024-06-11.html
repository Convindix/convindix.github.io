A philosophical distinction between the busy beaver and Rayo functions

There is a phenomenon relating to the continuum hypothesis which is often-discussed when talking about Rayo's number, which is that when defining Rayo's number for models of $\mathrm{ZFC}$, Rayo's number can be pushed arbitrarily large by forcing the continuum to be $\aleph_n$ for any desired numeral $n$.

There is no $\Sigma^0_1$ formula $\phi(n)$ such that $\phi(\overline n)$ is independent of ZFC for every natural number $n$, so there cannot be a Turing machine $\{e\}$ with a "CH-in-Rayo-like" scenario, where for every $n\in\mathbb N$ there is a model of ZFC in which $\{e\}$ outputs $n$. Only nonstanadrd natural shenanigans allowed
