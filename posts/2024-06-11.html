A philosophical distinction between the busy beaver and Rayo functions

There is a phenomenon relating to the continuum hypothesis which is often-discussed when talking about Rayo's number, which is that when defining Rayo's number for models of $\mathrm{ZFC}$, Rayo's number can be pushed arbitrarily large by forcing the continuum to be $\aleph_n$ for any desired numeral $n$.

There is no $\Sigma^0_1$ formula $\phi(n)$ such that $\phi(\overline n)$ is independent of ZFC for every natural number $n$, so there cannot be a Turing machine $\{e\}$ with a "CH-in-Rayo-like" scenario, where for every $n\in\mathbb N$ there is a model of ZFC in which $\{e\}$ outputs $n$. Only nonstanadrd natural shenanigans allowed

Conjecture: If $\phi(x)$ is $\Sigma^0_1$ and $\exists(x\in\mathbb N)\phi(x)$ is independent of ZFC, and $M$ is a model of ZFC such that $M\vDash\exists(x\in\mathbb N)\phi(x)$, then all $x\in\mathbb N^M$ such that $M\vDash\phi(x)$ are nonstandard.

I also conjecture that when allowing even a small part of the infinite part of the universe into the picture, even at the level of only $\mathcal P(\mathbb N)$, independent statements involving arbitrarily large standard naturals (akin to Rayo and CH) begin to appear.

Theorem 2: There is a $\Sigma^0_2$ formula $\phi$ such that $\exists(x\in\mathbb N)\phi(x)$ is independent of ZFC, and for every (standard) natural number $n$, there is a model $M_n$ of ZFC such that $M_n\vDash\phi(n)$.

Proof: Woodin's universal finite algorithm. $\square$

A corollary of the first conjecture is that even though the halting of machines may vary from model to model, all the $\omega$-models of ZFC have one correct busy beaver function. However, theorem 2 says that the same cannot be said even for Rayo just for $\Sigma^0_2$ formulas. (And even $\emptyset'$ busy beaver?)

Here is an older (October 2023) result of mine which is related to philosophical problems with Rayo. (Paste eventual domination result here)
