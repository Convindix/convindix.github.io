<p>Higher Paris-Harrington principles</p>

<p>A somewhat disappointing, but clear in retrospect, note on the Paris-Harrington principle at cardinals larger than $\aleph_0$</p>

<p>Define a subset of the natural numbers to be "relatively large" if its cardinality is greater than or equal to its least element. The Paris-Harrington principle states that for any natural numbers $m,e,c$, there is a natural number $b$ such that for any $c$-coloring $f:[b]^e\to c$ of the $e$-element subsets of $b$, there is a relatively large $H\subseteq b$ with $\vert H\vert\geq m$ that is homogeneous for $f$. This statement is denoted $b\underset{\ast}{\rightarrow}(m)^e_c$, with the difference from the usual Ramsey-theoretic statement $b\rightarrow(m)^e_c$ being the requirement that $H$ is relatively large.</p>

<p>This can be stated as "for all cardinals $m,c<\aleph_0$ and natural numbers $e$, there is a cardinal $b<\aleph_0$ such that $b\underset{\ast}{\rightarrow}(m)^e_c$".</p>

<p>What happens when considering versions of this principle for cardinals larger than $\aleph_0$? As $\pi\underset{\ast}{\rightarrow}(\alpha)^e_\lambda$ implies $\pi\rightarrow(\alpha)^e_\lambda$, if $\kappa$ has this property then there must be many $\alpha,\pi$ below $\kappa$ such that $\pi\rightarrow(\alpha)^e_\lambda$. The usual consequences of partition relations for infinite cardinals will then hold for $\pi\rightarrow(\alpha)^e_\lambda$, and the usual restrictions will be in place, for example assuming the axiom of choice $e$ may not be infinite. However, it turns out that higher Paris-Harrington principles at cardinals larger than $\aleph_0$ do not give much higher consistency strength than $\alpha$-Erd&odblac;sness.</p>

<p>For cardinal $\kappa$ let $\mathrm{RT}(\kappa)$ denote the statement "for all $\lambda<\kappa$ and natural numbers $e$, $\kappa\rightarrow(\kappa)^e_\lambda$?", and let $\mathrm{PH}(\kappa)$ denote the statement "for all cardinals $\alpha,\lambda<\kappa$ and natural numbers $e$, there is a cardinal $\pi<\kappa$ such that $\pi\underset{\ast}{\rightarrow}(\alpha)^e_\lambda$".</p>

<p>Lemma: If $\kappa$ is an infinite cardinal such that $\mathrm{RT}(kappa)$ holds, then K&odblac;nig's lemma for trees of size $\kappa$ holds.</p>

<p>Proof: If $\kappa$ is $\aleph_0$, then K&odblac;nig's lemma holds. If $\kappa>\aleph_0$, then $\kappa$ must be weakly compact, and there are no Aronszajn trees of size $\kappa$. $\square$</p>

<p>Theorem: Assume $\kappa$ is a weakly compact cardinal such that $\mathrm{RT}(\kappa)$ holds. Then $\mathrm{KP}(\kappa)$ holds.</p>

<p>Proof: We lift the original proof of the Paris-Harrington principle from the infinite Ramsey theorem. Assume towards a contradiction that $\mathrm{RT}(\kappa)$ holds but $\mathrm{KP}(\kappa)$ does not hold. Then for all $\alpha,\lambda,\pi<\kappa$ and natural number $e$ there is an $f:[\pi]^e\to\lambda$ that does not have a relatively large homogeneous subset with size at least $\alpha$. Let a counterexample refer to such a function $f$. Construct the tree of counterexamples as in ParisHarrington77, ordered by extension (and thus each counterexample on a higher level is for a larger $\pi$ than any counterexample on a lower level). This tree is $<\kappa$-branching, so by K&odblac;nig's lemma for trees of size $\kappa$ (applicable due to the previous lemma) it must have a branch $\langle f_\pi\mid\pi<\kappa\rangle$, linearly ordered by extension. Define $f$ to be the union $\bigcup_{\pi<\kappa}f_\pi$. This function $f$ is a function $f:[\kappa]^e\to \lambda$, and by $\mathrm{RT}(\kappa)$, there is a set $H\subseteq\kappa$ with $\kappa$ elements that is homogeneous for $\kappa$. Choose a $\xi<\kappa$ such that $H\cap\xi$ has at least as many elements as $\max\{\alpha,\min(H)\}$, then $H\cap\xi$ is a relatively large subset of $\xi$ homogeneous for $f_\xi$, contradicting our assumption that $\lnot\mathrm{PH}(\kappa)$. $\square$</p>
