Higher Paris-Harrington principles

A somewhat disappointing, but clear in retrospect, note on the Paris-Harrington principle at cardinals larger than $\aleph_0$

Define a subset of the natural numbers to be "relatively large" if its cardinality is greater than or equal to its least element. The Paris-Harrington principle states that for any natural numbers $m,e,c$, there is a natural number $b$ such that for any $c$-coloring $f:[b]^e\to c$ of the $e$-element subsets of $b$, there is a relatively large $H\subseteq b$ with $\vert H\vert\geq m$ that is homogeneous for $f$. This statement is denoted $b\underset{\ast}{\rightarrow}(m)^e_c$, with the difference from the usual Ramsey-theoretic statement $b\rightarrow(m)^e_c$ being the requirement that $H$ is relatively large.

This can be stated as "for all cardinals $m,c<\aleph_0$ and natural numbers $e$, there is a cardinal $b<\aleph_0$ such that $b\underset{\ast}{\rightarrow}(m)^e_c$". 

What happens when considering versions of this principle for cardinals larger than $\aleph_0$? As $\pi\underset{\ast}{\rightarrow}(\alpha)^e_\lambda$ implies $\pi\rightarrow(\alpha)^e_\lambda$, if $\kappa$ has this property then there must be many $\alpha,\pi$ below $\kappa$ such that $\pi\rightarrow(\alpha)^e_\lambda$. The usual consequences of partition relations for infinite cardinals will then hold for $\pi\rightarrow(\alpha)^e_\lambda$, and the usual restrictions will be in place, for example assuming the axiom of choice $e$ may not be infinite. However, it turns out that higher Paris-Harrington principles at cardinals larger than $\aleph_0$ do not give much higher consistency strength than $\alpha$-Erd&odblac;sness.

For cardinal $\kappa$ let $\mathrm{RT}(\kappa)$ denote the statement "for all cardinals $\alpha,\lambda<\kappa$ and natural numbers $e$, there is a cardinal $\pi<\kappa$ such that $\pi\rightarrow(\alpha)^e_\lambda$", and let $\mathrm{PH}(\kappa)$ denote the same statement but with $\rightarrow$ replaced with $\underset{\ast}{\rightarrow}$.

Theorem: Assume $\kappa$ is a cardinal such that $\mathrm{RT}(\kappa)$ holds. Then $\mathrm{KP}(\kappa)$ holds.

Proof: We reproduce the proof of the Paris-Harrington principle from the infinite Ramsey theorem, but from the partition relation $\kappa\rightarrow(\alpha)^e_\lambda$. Assume towards a contradiction that $\mathrm{RT}(\kappa)$ holds but $\mathrm{KP}(\kappa)$ does not hold. Then WIP$\square$
