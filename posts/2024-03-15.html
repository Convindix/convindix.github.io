<h1>Another connection between PA and ZFC</h1>
<p>Let $\mathrm{ZF}\lnot\mathrm{Inf}$ be the theory $\mathrm{ZF}$ but with the axiom of infinity negated. It is already well-known that $\mathrm{PA}$ and $\mathrm{ZF}\lnot\mathrm{Inf}$ are mutually interpretable. (A strictly stronger result which needs some clarification is described as folklore in Kaye and Wong's "<a href="https://web.mat.bham.ac.uk/R.W.Kaye/publ/papers/finitesettheory/finitesettheory.pdf">On interpretations of arithmetic and set theory</a>", 2007.) It is also known (ibid.) that fragments of $\mathrm{ZF}\lnot\mathrm{Inf}$ (when axiomaitzed with $\in$induction) and fragments of $\mathrm{PA}$ are mutually interpretable.</p>

<p>There is a theorem of Montague and Vaught that if $\kappa$ is such that there is an ordinal $\alpha>\kappa$ such that $V_\alpha$ is an elementary extension of $V_\kappa$, then $V_\kappa$ is a model of $\mathrm{ZF}$ (Marek, "<a href="https://eudml.org/doc/214661">Stable sets, a characterization of $\beta_2$-models of full second order arithmetic and some related facts</a>" p.186). (Note: this implication is the other direction from the next one.) On the side of arithmetic, the MacDowell-Specker theorem states that every model of $\mathrm{PA}$ has a nontrivial elementary end-extension. When looking at fragments of $\mathrm{PA}$, it has been shown that every model of $\mathsf I\Sigma_n$ has a nontrivial $\Sigma^0_n$-elementary end extension (Kossak, "<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03156">63 years of the MacDowell-Specker theorem</a>", 2022, p.5). Here we prove an analogous theorem for $\mathrm{ZF}$, that if $V_\kappa$ models $\mathrm{ZF}_n$, then there is an ordinal $\alpha>\kappa$ such that $V_\kappa\prec_{\Sigma_n}V_\alpha$.</p>

<p>Theorem 1: If there is an ordinal $\alpha>\kappa$ such that $V_\kappa\prec_{\Sigma_n}V_\alpha$, then $V_\kappa$ models $\mathrm{ZF}_n$. (Other direction)</p>
