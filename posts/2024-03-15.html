<h1>Another connection between PA and ZFC</h1>
<p>Let $\mathrm{ZF}\lnot\mathrm{Inf}$ be the theory $\mathrm{ZF}$ but with the axiom of infinity negated. It is already well-known that $\mathrm{PA}$ and $\mathrm{ZF}\lnot\mathrm{Inf}$ are mutually interpretable. (A strictly stronger result which needs some clarification is described as folklore in Kaye and Wong's "<a href="https://web.mat.bham.ac.uk/R.W.Kaye/publ/papers/finitesettheory/finitesettheory.pdf">On interpretations of arithmetic and set theory</a>", 2007.) It is also known (ibid.) that fragments of $\mathrm{ZF}\lnot\mathrm{Inf}$ (when axiomaitzed with $\in$induction) and fragments of $\mathrm{PA}$ are mutually interpretable.</p>
